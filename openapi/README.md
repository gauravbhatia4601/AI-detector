# OpenAPI Specifications

This directory contains hand-authored OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for each HTTP
service contained in the monorepo. The documents can be imported into tooling
such as Postman, Insomnia, or Stoplight Studio to explore and test the
microservices.

The specs mirror the behavior of the lightweight implementations shipped in the
repository and focus on documenting request/response payloads that feed the
policy orchestrator.
